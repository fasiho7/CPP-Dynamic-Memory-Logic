# C++ Dynamic Memory & Logic Challenges

A collection of C++ programs focusing on manual memory management, pointer manipulation, and algorithmic efficiency.

## 🚀 Key Concepts Covered
* **Dynamic Memory:** Using `new` and `delete` for 1D arrays to prevent memory leaks.
* **String Algorithms:** Frequency counting, subsequence detection, and tokenization.
* **Pointer Arithmetic:** Sorting and navigating arrays using pointer notation instead of indices.
* **Data Structures:** Implementing a manual resizing logic for dynamic arrays (Vector-like behavior).

## 🛠️ Problems Solved
1. **Repeated Letter Analysis:** Finds the word with the highest internal character frequency.
2. **Subsequence Checker:** Efficiently checks if one string exists within another while maintaining order.
3. **Odd-Even Stable Sort:** Reorders arrays using pointer notation.
4. **Greedy Sum Optimization:** Maximizes sums based on $K$ distinct integer constraints.
